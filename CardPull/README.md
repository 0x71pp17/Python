## README: `draw_a_card.py`

A command-line card drawing simulation that generates, shuffles, and displays playing cards.

### Features
- Creates a standard 52-card deck with suits and ranks.
- Shuffles the deck for random draws.
- Allows the user to draw one or multiple cards at a time.
- Displays each drawn card with a stylized ASCII art representation.

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6 or later**

### Usage
Run the script:
```bash
python draw_a_card.py
```

1.  The program will prompt you to enter the number of cards you want to draw.
2.  Enter a number. The program will draw that many cards from the top of the shuffled deck.
3.  Each card will be displayed in a visual format showing its rank and suit.
4.  The process repeats until the deck is empty.
5.  When all cards are drawn, the program will display "We are out of cards." and exit.
